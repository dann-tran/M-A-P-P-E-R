        <h1>Meaningless Articulation of Pointless Progression in an Eroding Republic (M-A-P-P-E-R)</h1>
        <p>M-A-P-P-E-R is created with the intention to playfully examine and critique modalities of power and resistance in the Foucauldian and Deleuzian traditions.</p>
        <p>M-A-P-P-E-R is by no means a serious affair. It simply aims to create whimsical interactions that could probe into deeper, but nevertheless potentially non-existent, implications.</p>
        <p>M-A-P-P-E-R is written purely in JavaScript and HTML, programming languages that dictate how a web browser decodes the human-constructed commands into executable graphics and interactions.</p>
        <p>M-A-P-P-E-R is designed to take on two legible forms: M-A-P-P-E-R.txt, M-A-P-P-E-R.html. They can be read independently, or in parallel, on a computer equipped with a text editor and a web browser (preferably Chrome). </p>
        <p>M-A-P-P-E-R is mutable. The viewer is free to modify the codes - rules that govern M-A-P-P-E-R's operations and interactivity. If you wish, you can send a copy of your modified M-A-P-P-E-R to picasdan99@gmail.com, for my own curiosity.</p>
        <p>M-A-P-P-E-R therefore opens up possibilities for interactions with not only its graphical interface and the embodied rules, but also with the underlying HTML and JavaScript codes, subject to their own syntax and logic.</p>
